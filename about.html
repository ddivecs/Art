    <p class = "aboutP">Great artwork can be found anywhere: even on the streets; most of the famous art pieces are found in museums. Unfortunately, not all artists receive the recognition they deserve (they're either too far from transportation services or they're lacking in funds), which is why our team designed this website to help artists around the world get the recognition they deserved by providing them with a museum-like structural setting.</p>
    <p class = "aboutP">We've designed this website to allow currators and artists to interact with one another without ever having to leave the comfort of home; not only are currators allowed to interact with artists, but other users from around the world may view the art pieces that have been submitted. If the deal isn't sweetened enough, fans of the artists' works may help contribute to the art piece by donating bit coins to keep the artwork alive!</p>
